# split-av-file-by-srt

You can use this bash script to automatically split video files up into seperate chunks based on timecodes from an .srt subtitle file.

This could be useful for:

- language learners looking to make an Anki deck out of phrases from a movie or TV show.
- people looking for an easier way to edit and export a large number of smaller clips from a larger file

I reccomend [Subtitle Edit](http://www.nikse.dk/SubtitleEdit/) for making subtitle files.

`usage: .\srt-split.sh [video file] [subtitle file] (optional)[output format]`

This script takes the timecodes out of the .srt file and outputs a seperate video file for each subtitle duration. You are also given an option to export the clips to the file format of your choice. If no output format is supplied, the clips will be exported in the same format as the original.

**requires ffmpeg**

More features and functionality to come. Contributions welcome.
